# Hey there :wave:

I am a second-year undergraduate student at the University of Edinburgh, studying Computer Science and Mathematics (BSc Hons). In particular, I am interested in the use and application of mathematical concepts to computer programs. In addition, I have a passion for teaching mathematics, computer science, and more! 

I am currently looking for internships in the summer of 2025. Find my CV [here](https://www.oliversoeser.com/pdf/cv.pdf).
