# Hey there :wave:

I am an undergrad going into my third year at the University of Edinburgh, studying Computer Science and Mathematics. My main interests are in applying rigorous mathematical proof methods to computer programs. In addition, I have a passion for teaching mathematics and computer science!

Currently, I am a Scientific Intern in the [Sammler Group](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/sammler-group/) at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, working on higher-order concurrent separation logic in Lean.
