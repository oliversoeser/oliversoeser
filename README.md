# Hey there :wave:

I am an undergraduate student going into my second year at the University of Edinburgh, studying Computer Science and Mathematics (BSc Hons). In particular, I am interested in the use and application of mathematical concepts in computer programs. In addition I have a passion for creating high-quality educational resources to teach others about mathematics and computer science.
